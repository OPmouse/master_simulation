In this paper, as a solution to the sensing error under multiple ON/OFF environment for Spectrum Database, a transition point detection algorithm is applied for the received power detection. Based on the detected transition point of the primary user status by using CUSUM algorithm and GLR algorithm. an active period of the primary user can be extracted. Transition point is well-detected and an improvement of sensing error can be confirmed through simulation results.
