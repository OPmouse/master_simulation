In Chapter \ref{chapter:Database}, the overview of spectrum sharing with spectrum database and the measurement-based Spectrum Database proposed by our laboratory. And a problem of Spectrum Database Construction is described.

\section{Overview of Spectrum Sharing with Spectrum Database}
For further improving the performance for spectrum sharing, Federal Communications Commission(FCC), an independent agency of the United States government,proposed to fully utilize spectrum database for supporting spectrum sharing. Secondary User should obtain own postion by Global Position System(GPS) and access to database. FCC has already released the detailed rule of construction and managementfor TV broadcasting White Space and some service provider corporation have already established spectrum databases.\cite{ref:fcc,ref:google,ref:microsoft}.
